    <h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>
<p>Hey! I'm Arjun, a Data Science undergrad at IIT Madras. I am passionate about using AI in the education and bio-tech fields, where I believe it can help make meaningful advances.</p>
<p>Between 2023–'24, I taught Python as a TA at IIT Madras. Now I'm focused on ML and AI, and write about some of my learnings and experiments on my blog. I am exploring the application of Computer Vision and NLP techniques to solve problems in healthcare and teaching.</p>
<p>Previously, I have built data-driven mobile apps that benefit everyday life, with a focus on accessible UI design. Inspired by my own weight-loss journey, I made an <a href="/projects/#taptrack">iOS app</a> to help users stay fit. I won a scholarship from Apple in 2023 for creating an educational <a href="/projects/#ciphers">cryptography puzzle game</a>. </p>
<p>In my free time, I like to draw, read or watch well-written shows with interesting characters. I share the growing concern about AI creeping into creative fields. As such I'm interested by projects like <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/">Glaze</a> and in discussions around AI regulation.</p>
<p>If you're interested in collaborating with me on anything AI/ML related, feel free to reach out using the contact info available in the footer.</p>
<h3 id="colophon">Colophon</h3>
<p>Much of the content is written using Markdown. I use <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola SSG</a> to convert it to HTML, with syntax highlighting for the code snippets and such. The fonts are IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Mono.</p>
<p>In an effort to keep things minimal, I've stuck to using only plain HTML and CSS. I avoid JavaScript like the plague, except for a small Google Analytics snippet to measure page views. Any illustrations you see were drawn by me using Procreate.</p>
