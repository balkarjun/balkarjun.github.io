    <h3 id="hey">Hey...</h3>
<p>I'm Arjun.</p>
<p>I'm currently juggling the final semesters of my degree from IIT Madras with a full-time Data Science job in Bangalore.</p>
<p>I like to draw, read short books and watch character-driven stories. I've recently taken an interest in rock-climbing (bouldering), and in improving my health and fitness. I plan to use this space to write about the things I like.</p>
<p>I've tried various things over the years, like – starting a YouTube channel to teach programming, building a <a href="/projects/#taptrack">weight-tracking app</a> for iOS, a cryptography <a href="/projects/#ciphers">puzzle game</a> for iPad, and teaching Python as a TA at IIT Madras.</p>
<p>Although developing and making use of AI tools is part of my day job, I share the growing disdain for AI, particularly for its ill use in the creative fields. As such I'm interested by projects like <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/">Glaze</a> and in discussions around AI regulation.</p>
<p>Want to collaborate? Feel free to reach out using the contact info in the footer :)</p>
<h3 id="colophon">Colophon</h3>
<p>I write in Markdown and use <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.getzola.org/">Zola SSG</a> to convert it to HTML and CSS. Since I'm allergic to JavaScript, I use just a <em>tiny</em> bit of it to measure page views.</p>
<p>The fonts are IBM Plex Sans/Mono. All illustrations are mine, drawn using Procreate.</p>
