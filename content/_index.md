### About Me

Hey! I'm Arjun, an undergrad studying Data Science from IIT Madras.

I build ML and AI projects, some of which I write about on my blog. I love learning and teaching math and programming. I spent a semester as a TA for an introductory programming course at IIT Madras. I live in Bangalore and I'm looking for Data Science internships.

Previously, I developed software with a focus on accessible UI design. Inspired by my own health journey, I made an [iOS app](/projects/#taptrack) to help users reach their fitness goals. I won a scholarship from Apple in 2023 for creating a [cryptography puzzle game](/projects/#ciphers).  

I like to draw in my free time. I'm inspired by the works of artists like Kim Jung Gi, Yoh Yoshinari and Karla Ortiz to name a few. I enjoy good stories and appreciate the craftsmanship of well-made movies, shows and manga. I'm a slow reader but I'm trying to read more books this year. 

I share the growing concern about AI creeping into creative fields. As such I'm interested by projects like [Glaze](https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/) and in discussions around AI regulation.

### Colophon
This site was built using the [Zola SSG](https://www.getzola.org/). It lets me write content in Markdown and convert it to HTML, with syntax highlighting for the code snippets and such. It's great! The fonts are IBM Plex Sans and IBM Plex Mono.

In an effort to keep things minimal, I don't use any libraries or frameworks. I avoid JavaScript like the plague, except for Google Analytics (to measure page views). All the illustrations, unless noted otherwise, were drawn by me using Procreate.
