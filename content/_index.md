### Hey...
I'm Arjun.

I'm currently juggling the final semesters of my degree from IIT Madras with a full-time Data Science job in Bangalore.

I like to draw, read short books and watch character-driven stories. I've recently taken an interest in rock-climbing (bouldering), and in improving my health and fitness. I plan to use this space to write about the things I like.

I've tried various things over the years, like â€“ starting a YouTube channel to teach programming, building a [weight-tracking app](/projects/#taptrack) for iOS, a cryptography [puzzle game](/projects/#ciphers) for iPad, and teaching Python as a TA at IIT Madras.

Although developing and making use of AI tools is part of my day job, I share the growing disdain for AI, particularly for its ill use in the creative fields. As such I'm interested by projects like [Glaze](https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/) and in discussions around AI regulation.

### Colophon
I write in Markdown and use [Zola SSG](https://www.getzola.org/) to convert it to HTML and CSS. Since I'm allergic to JavaScript, I use just a *tiny* bit of it to measure page views.

The fonts are IBM Plex Sans/Mono. All illustrations are mine, drawn using Procreate.
