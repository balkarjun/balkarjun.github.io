An interactive Connect Four game with a powerful AI opponent. The AI uses a depth-limited minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning. 
It was written in C++ and compiled to WebAssembly resulting in a <em>blazingly fast</em> AI that can run locally on the browser. The interface was made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
